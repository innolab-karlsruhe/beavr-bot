## Overview

BeaVR is an open-source, end-to-end teleoperation pipeline that leverages affordable hardware for robotic teleoperation.

Key features:
- **VR teleoperation out-of-the-box** – Stream low-latency control and visual feedback through Meta Quest 3 (and any OculusVR supported device) while recording synchronized proprioceptive, visual, and action data.
- **Multi-embodiment support** – Ships with drivers and URDF assets for the RX-1 full-size humanoid and an xArm + LeapHand dexterous work-cell. The modular hardware abstraction layer lets you drop in new robots with a single interface file.
- **Simulation parity** – Mirror every real-world session in MuJoCo or Isaac Gym for rapid domain-randomized policy training or sim-to-real transfer.
- **Dexterous demonstration collection** – Capture single-hand, bi-manual, or whole-body demonstrations for manipulation, assembly, or locomotion tasks—no motion-capture stage required.
- **Budget-friendly extensibility** – Works on commodity PCs and laptops with accessible robotics hardware.

### Why use BeaVR?
- **Accessible** – No proprietary hardware or licenses; every component is student-budget friendly and permissively BSD-3-licensed.
- **Modular & maintainable** – Clean and performant Python and ROS modules.
- **LeRobot formatted data** – Standardizing data collection for shared robotics projects.
- **Community-driven** – Contributions already include UR-series arms, quadrupeds, and tactile grippers; PRs with new morphologies are welcome.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Linux system or containerized environment (see [Docker folder](docker))
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended)
- Meta Quest 3 VR headset
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (install with: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
- Build tools: `build-essential`, `python3-dev` (for compiling C extensions)
- Rust compiler (optional, only needed if building from source): Install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) or `sudo apt install rustup && rustup default stable`

### Installation

#### uv Environment (Recommended)

For development and running the full system with all dependencies (including PyTorch and simulation tools), we recommend using uv:

```bash
# Install Python 3.10.13
uv python install 3.10.13

# Create virtual environment with Python 3.10.13
uv venv --python 3.10.13

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

After setting up the environment, install BeaVR as a package using uv:

```bash
# Install all dependencies including dev extras
uv sync --extra dev

# This will create a uv.lock file and install everything
```

Alternatively, you can use pip:
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Set up pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

Verify the installation:
```bash
python -c "import sys;
try: import beavr; print('BeaVR successfully installed!')
except ImportError: print('An error occurred'); sys.exit(1)"
```

## Documentation

Full documentation lives in the [`docs`](docs) directory. Start with
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) for an overview of the available guides,
including detailed explanations of the teleoperation and LeRobot stacks.

## Additional Features

### Apple Vision Pro Support
BeaVR only requires cartesian positions from VR headsets in the standard y-up right-hand coordinate frame used by VR systems.
Apple Vision Pro users can connect through the third-party Improbable AI's [Tracking Streamer App](https://github.com/Improbable-AI/VisionProTeleop) that provides independent hand pose tracking.
This app should seamlessly integrate with BeaVR as an alternative VR endpoint. Although, it has not been developed or tested for this purpose.
